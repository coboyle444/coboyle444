#### My name is **Courtlyn O'Boyle**, a first-year student in hopes of getting a diploma in Interactive Design. 

My background lies in the realm of film, photography, and a Bachelor's degree in English literature. 

So, while I have invested much of my time to researching the Victorian Era, I appreciate the 21st century and the technologies that come with it. My passion for graphic design stemmed from logo-making and poster work for colleague's businesses.
